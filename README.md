# üìä Sales Analysis Dashboard

## üåü Problem Statement
A consumer goods company spanning categories such as Electronics, Footwear, Clothing, Home Appliances, Accessories, Kitchenware, Bags, and Personal Care requires actionable insights into its sales, profit, and customer buying behavior. The goal is to empower business stakeholders with interactive, visual dashboards that spotlight product performance, regional demand, profitability, discount effectiveness, and order-level dynamics for informed decision making.

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a hypothetical store using Power BI. The goal is to enable stakeholders to identify patterns, track performance, and make informed decisions. The process includes:
- **Data Profiling & Transformation:** Cleaned, merged, and transformed data using Power Query.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Created highly interactive visualizations across six report pages.
- **Key Business Insights:** Derived actionable insights using calculated metrics and relationships.

## üìÇ Dataset Details
**File Name:** `Store+Data.xlsx`

The dataset consists of four sheets:
- **Dim Customers:** Customer details (`Customer ID`, `Customer Name`, `City`, `State`, `Pincode`, `EmailID`, `Phone Number`)
- **Dim Product:** Product details (`ProductID`, `Product Name`, `Product Line`, `Price Per Unit (INR)`)
- **Dim Promotion:** Promotion details (`PromotionID`, `Promotion Name`, `Ad Type`, `Coupon Code`, `Price Reduction Type`, `Percentage`)
- **Fact Table:** Order details (`OrderID`, `Date`, `CustomerID`, `PromotionID`, `ProductID`, `Units Sold`, `Price Per Unit`, `Total Sales`, `Discount Percentage`, `Discount Value`, `Net Sales`, `Profit`)

## üîß Data Transformation

### Key Steps
1. **Index Column:** Added `OrderID` as a unique identifier starting from 1.
2. **Merging Queries:** Joined fact table with dimension tables to enrich data.
3. **Calculated Columns:**
    - `Total Sales` = `Units Sold` * `Price Per Unit`
    - `Discount Value` = calculated using `Discount Percentage`
    - `Net Sales` = `Total Sales` - `Discount Value`
    - `Profit` = `Net Sales * 10%` (assumed)
4. **Data Profiling:** Ensured data quality by handling null values and duplicates.
5. **Relationship Setup:** Established one-to-many relationships for smooth interaction between tables.
